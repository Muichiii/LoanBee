# LoanBee 🐝 – Business Loan System

## Project Overview
**LoanBee** is a loan bank system developed to demonstrate **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations** in a practical, real-world application. The system allows users to create accounts, apply for loans, and track the status of their applications, while administrators manage loan records and oversee the loan approval process. This project simulates a basic loan management workflow commonly used in banking systems.
